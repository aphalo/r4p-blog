::: callout-note
This page has been replaced by the article [Animated plots of spectral data](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/ggspectra/articles/animated-plots.html) included in the [on-line documentation of R package 'ggspectra' version >= 0.3.16](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/ggspectra/).

The reason for this migration is that the interaction between packages
['ggspectra'](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/ggspectra/),
['gganimate'](https://gganimate.com/) and
['ggplot2'](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) is rather fragile and the examples
need frequent checks and updates. This is better handled in the package
documentation than in a page at this website.
