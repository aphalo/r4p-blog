## Practicalities

-   Use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) in
    [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/), so that we can create both a
    book and a web site and release drafts and chapters as a web site as
    we make progress.

-   Quarto is easy to use for authors and the same manuscript can be
    used to produce output in different formats, quite easily.

-   This means we could publish drafts as we make progress to keep
    authors and uv4plants members engaged.

-   I have been using Quarto for several months. I transferred my two
    websites and I have been very happy with how it works. [Using R for
    Photobiology](https://www.r4photobiology.info/) and [Photo Rumblings
    and Whispers](https://www.photo-spectrum.info/).

## Title

-   Methods in Plant Photobiology: From Principles to Practice (?)

## Scope

-   Wavelength scope: 280--900,nm (expand to include VIS and FR).
-   Exclude methods used at the lab bench (as before).
-   Should we include gas-exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence??? (in
    my opinion, not gas-exchange; fluorescence possibly).

## Editors

-   Pedro A.
-   Wolgang Bilger
-   Eva Rosenqvist (?)
-   Marcel Jansen

## Publisher

-   Self (pre-print on-line)
-   CRC/Taylor & Francis
-   other?

## Chapters for 2nd edition

0.  Preface

   -    xxx

1.  [Radiation and optics](BTV2-radiation-and-optics.html) (Previously: *Introduction*)

    -   Make text more accessible to those not-mathematically minded.
        (Pedro + LOB + Andreas Albert (?) + Ylianttila (?))
    -   Update colour definitions to follow ISO/CIE. (Pedro)
    -   Discuss reflectance vs. angle of incidence. (Pedro + LOB)
    -   Discuss the mechanisms behind fluorescence and luminiscence.
        (Pedro + LOB)
    -   Do we need a brief introduction to light sensing by plants?
    -   *Move discussion of radiation in the environment to new chapter
        2.*

2.  The UV and VIS environment of plants (New chapter)

    -   Emphasize more the climatology of UV and VIS. Including
        up-to-date maps. (Daniele Griffoni + Anders Lindfords)
    -   Latitudinal and diurnal variation in VIS spectrum, including
        R:FR.
    -   Discuss in depth waveband ratios in nature (Pedro + Matt?).
    -   Discuss light distribution and sunflecks in canopies (Maxime
        Durand)
    -   Update and expand text on light in aquatic environments. (Pirjo
        Huovinen + Ivan GÃ³mez?)

3.  Manipulating UV and VIS radiation (Previosuly: *Manipulating UV
    radiation*)

    -   Update safety considerations to address current regulations and
        recomendations.
    -   Expand material on LEDs, including approaches to dimming and
        pulse generation. (Pedro)
    -   Discuss diffuse vs. direct light from artificial sources.
        (Pedro)
    -   Is an update on films and filters needed?
    -   Greenhouse screens (based on spectral data from Matthew Robson
        and Titta Kotilainen)

4.  Quantifying UV and VIS radiation (Previously: *Quantifying UV
    radiation*)

    -   Update information on input optics. (Pedro)
    -   Update equipment examples to those currently available. (Pedro)
    -   Simulation of the solar spectrum (Anders Lindfors)

5.  Measurement of optical properties of leaves and materials\] New
    chapter.

    -   Epidermal transmittance, etc. (Wolfgang Bilger)
    -   Reflectance and transmittance of whole leaves (?)
    -   Filters, etc., (Pedro)
    -   Fluorescence.
    -   Optical measurement of chloroplast accumulation (Justyna (?) +
        Pawel (?))

6.  UV, VIS and IR photography, and spectral imaging (New chapter)

    -   Cameras and lenses (Pedro)
    -   UV induced VIS and NIR fluorescence and VIS induced NIR
        fluorescence (Pedro + Ylianttila (?))
    -   Image editing (Pedro + Eva Rosenqvist?)

7.  Plant cultivation (Previously: Plant cultivation)

    -   LED spectra for plant cultivation (Eva Rosenqvist + Pedro)
    -   Cultivation of aquatic plants (Pirjo huovinen)
    -   Cultivation of terrestrial plants (?)
    -   DLI dialy light integral (Titta Kotilainen (?))
    -   Mineral nutrition
    -   Water supply

8.  Design and planning of photobiological experiments (Previously:
    *Design of photobiological experiments*)

    -   Statistical design (Pedro, not much to do.)
    -   Data analysis
    -   Functional ANOVA of spectra and related methods (Pedro?, Titta?)
    -   Sampling procedures for laboratory analyses (Pedro?, Neha?,
        Luis?)
    -   ??

9.  Imaging in UV, VIS and IR\] Possible new chapter.
