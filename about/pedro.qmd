I am a senior university lecturer in _physiological plant ecology_ and principal investigator at the [Organismal and Evolutionary Biology Research Programme (OEB)](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/faculty-biological-and-environmental-sciences/research/organismal-and-evolutionary-biology), [Faculty of Biological and Environmental Sciences](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/faculty-biological-and-environmental-sciences) of the [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en) and member of the [Viikki Plant Science Center (ViPS)](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/viikki-plant-science-centre).

I am the leader of the research group [Sensory and Physiological Ecology of Plants (SenPEP)](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/senpep-blog).

# My background

I have been using and teaching [R](https://www.r-project.org/), the free
software environment for statistical computing and graphics, for more
than 20 years. I am a researcher working in the field of sensory ecology
of plants. I have been interested throughout my career in plants'
responses to light.

In my research group we have used R for general data analysis, as well
as for plotting and calculations related to photobiology. We are also using
R for the near-real time acquisition of light spectra, and time series of 
light spectra. As a result of
all these activities I developed several R packages and published them
through CRAN. I have also written books both on R and on photobiology.

I had a [separate website for my research group's
activities](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/senpep-blog/) (with contents
that I am slowly transferring to [its own section here](../senpep-posts.qmd)) 
and I have a [website with
material related to photography and photography
techniques](https://www.photo-spectrum.info/). My scientific
publications are listed at my [ORCID
profile](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3385-972X).

I published my first website, *The Plant Photobiology Notes*, between
1995 and 2001. Initially it was hosted in the desktop PC in my office,
the same I used everyday for other tasks. The site survived with minor
updates, mostly deletion of broken links, until around 2009. In the
meantime the URL changed two or three times when I changed jobs. Much of
its contents are now outdated but [the site was archived by the Wayback
Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://cc.joensuu.fi/photobio*)
and remains available. Most of the spectral data at the old site are now
included in my R packages together with newer data.
