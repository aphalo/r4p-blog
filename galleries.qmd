# What are these galleries?

These pages contain collections of R code examples using a "cookbook-like" approach. Many of these examples make use of packages 'ggpp', 'ggpmisc', "gginnards' or from the R for photobiology suite. Frequently, they are together with other packages, thus are several of these examples are unsuitable for inclusion in the packages' documentation.

A couple of these pages focus on downloading data from specific on-line APIs.
