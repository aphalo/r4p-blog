Since moving the site to Quarto I am updating this post to give a concise
overview of changes. Differences between versions are listed in detail in the
[NEWS file](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/ggpp/news/).

## Overview of changes

_Version 0.5.8_ brings a bug fix in two documentation code examples and a small enhancement to `position_nudge_to()`.

_Version 0.5.7_ brings helpers function `wrap_labels()`, `as_npc()`, `as_npcx()` and `as_npcy()` together with enhancements to `geom_point_s()`, `geom_text_s()`, `geom_label_s()`. `geom_text_pairwise()` and 
`geom_label_pairwise()`, mostly fixing bugs and adding new features from 'ggplot2' 3.5.0. Updated `stat_fmt_table()` allows application of functions to columns. **Depends on 'ggplot2' >= 3.5.0.**

_Version 0.5.6_ brings bug fixes.

_Version 0.5.5_ brings compatibility with 'ggplot2' >= 3.5.0. Adds support for `angle`aesthetic to geoms that are variations on `geom_label()`. Add support for error bars in stacked columns. Add example data sets.

_Version 0.5.4_ brings two new geometries `geom_text_pairwise()` and `geom_label_pairwise()` useful for adding to plots the outcomes from pairwise tests, and for highlighting ranges along the _x_ axis.

_Version 0.5.3_ brings enhancements to `stat_quadrant_counts()` and `stat_group_counts()`. They are now both based on a _compute panel_ function, which makes it possible to compute the same counts as in earlier versions but also the count for the whole panel. This in turn facilitates the creation of labels based on percents and fractions of the total number of observations. The default behaviour remains the same as in earlier versions, with labels for counts.

_Version 0.5.2_ brings additional enhancements to the density-based statistics. Mainly smoothing the rough edges left by the overhaul done in _version 0.5.1_ to these functions. A change to `position_nudge_to()` makes it possible to evenly spread positions to reduce overlaps. **Most importantly** add many unit tests to reach > 90% code coverage by tests (contribution of Daniel Sabanés Bové and his team). 

_Version 0.5.1_ brings enhancements to the density-based statistics. They gain new features without changing their default behaviour allowing improved support of the annotation of volcano and quadrant plots. The new statistic `stat_functions()` implements plotting of multiple functions per layer and supports groups and facets.

_Version 0.5.0_ includes **code-breaking** enhancements to `geom_text_s()` and `geom_label_s()`. The most significative is a mechanism to selectively applying aesthetics, replacing use of separate aesthetics for segments or arrows. Please see [Enhancing geom_text() and geom_label()](../Enhancing-geom-text/) for example plots.
New functions `stat_panel_counts()` and `stat_group_counts()` for annotations showing the number of observations.
