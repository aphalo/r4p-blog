Versions 0.3.0, 0.3.1 and 0.3.2 are feature and bug-fix updates. Nearly all
changes are related to the interactive measurement of spectral irradiance with
function `acq_irrad_interactive()`. Some of the enhancements required changes
to lower level functions so these functions also have enhancements. Some of
the bugs fixed affected all data acquisition related functions.

The most important new feature is the _automatic acquisition of time series of
spectra_. I started developing this feature long ago but only now I got it
working smoothly. The task was simplified by enhancements I recently implemented
in packages 'photobiology' (0.10.16) and 'ggspectra' (0.3.11). A major incentive
was that I needed this feature for some measurements I wanted to do. In version
0.3.1 I implemented as a variation on the new "series" interface mode of 0.3.0
the support for high speed acquisition of time series of spectra using the
special functions in the OmniDriver API. The API wrappers are already
implemented in 'rOmniDriver' (>= 0.1.18) and starting from 'ooacquire' (0.3.1)
is the minimum version of 'rOmniDriver' supported.

**Before using the new `"series"` mode for acquiring spectra at a rate faster 
than about once per minute, please read [the 'ooacquire' vignette
that describes acquisition of
spectra](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/ooacquire/articles/userguide-acquisition.html).
This is crucial as timing considerations are far from straightforward because of
how spectrometers work.**

Support for _OmniDriver version 2.56_ from 2018 remains important, as this seems
to be the last version supporting old spectrometers, including an USB2000 that I
am still using. Compatibility with Windows 10 requires a firmware update of the
USB2000. (This firmware version is not recognized by OmniDriver 2.56, but this
has only minor consequences for its use.)

Another enhancement is the possibility of storing of additional information in
the instrument descriptors: storage of a description of the entrance optics used
(make, model, serial number, area of diffuser, and optical fibre) and the source
of the calibration data (e.g., file name or spectrometer EEPROM). This allows
reliably using a given spectrometer with different entrance optics, with a
different calibration for each one.

Version 0.3.2 exports function `irrad_summary_table()`, which is an enhanced
version of a function previously used only internally by the package. The
enhancements are reflected in the summary table created when saving collections
of spectra.

Version 0.3.2 adds a _repeat_ entry to the menu shown at the end of a
measurement event. This makes it possible to quickly take a new measurement
without modifying the integration time settings or protocol used, reusing
the previous "dark" and "light" measurements for a new "light" measurement.
In "series" mode, the parameters of the series can still be modified.

In addition, I implemented some minor enhancements to the user interface of
previously available modes: wording of options in menus, a new option to skip
automatic tuning of integration time and clearer progress messages.

Following the bug fix in 'photobiologyWavebands', in 'ooacquire' versions >=
0.3.1  users can choose between _PAR_ and _PhR_ waveband definitions. PhR is
defined as a range of wavelengths while PAR is defined as a biologically
effective quantity based on McCree's definition. When used to compute photon
irradiance or photon fluence PhR and PAR do not differ. However, when used to
compute energy irradiance they result in different values and represent
different quantities. The magnitude of the difference depends on the shape of
the measured spectrum.

I also added data for new calibrations of two of our own spectrometers.

The critical bugs fixed were caused by changes to the OmniDriver API in versions
2.70 and 2.71. These changes broke data acquisition with 'ooacquire' because a
function that had been in use was removed from the OmniDriver API. The most
recent version, 2.71, is now supported, while versions 2.46 and 2.56 continue to
work. Possibly versions of OmniDriver released before and in-between these also
work but I have not tested 'ooacquire' with them.

The function that was removed from the OmniDriver API and previsouly used in
'ooacquire' made it possible to query the optical bench configuration from the
spectrometer. When a descriptor of the spectrometer with calibration information
has been included as part of 'ooacquire' the optical bench description attached
as metadata to spectra will remain unchanged. However, in those cases when the
calibration is retrieved from the spectrometer EEPROM, with the new versions of
OmniDriver information about the optical bench will be missing from the
metadata. When creating descriptors for new spectrometers the metadata about the
optical bench will have to be entered manually. _The information stored
in the EEPROM and returned by this function was not always correct, so this
change is not much of drawback. I need to explore if a different way of
retrieving this information in the new versions of OmniDriver_

An additional bug was caused, most likely, by changes in package 'lubridate'. I
noticed during testing that wrong times were in some cases retrieved from the
computer. Most likely this was because of the change in the default time zone
used in 'lubridate' or because of some major code base changes and bug fixes in
'lubridate' 1.9.0. These changes may have interacted with code in 'ooacquire' that
unwisely relied on default arguments in functions imported from 'lubridate'. It
is possible that time stamps may have been wrongly recorded with some recent
combinations of 'ooacquire' and 'lubridate' versions. _Safest is to update both
packages, and check the timing recorded in recently acquired spectra for time
shifts._ In case time shifts happened, I would expect differences of at least several
hours, depending on the local time zone and its time offset to UTC. In this
version UTC is used explicitly everywhere to keep things as simple and reliable
as possible. Currently messages related to time series acquisition report times
in UTC, which may be surprising. Plots include timezone information with the
time stamp.

Some enhancements are still pending: 1) better documentation and 2) unit
tests for data acquisition based on the underlying functions as these do not
need interactive user input. These would need to be run _live_ with
spectrometers. Current unit tests are based on stored raw counts data and test
computations used to convert raw counts into physical units and the reading of
raw spectral data stored in the different file formats supported.

In the future it may be necessary to remove the dependency on OmniDriver, which
is proprietary, closed source software written in Java. Java itself is no longer
free for commercial use since Oracle changed the more permissive licencing SUN
had for Java. The alternative is SeaBreeze, in its original version written in
C, or the Python version of it. Python is easier to interface to R, but the C
implementation could be faster.

Already well tested by me with two different spectrometers and a few hundreds of 
measurements, as of 2023-04-18 I think version 0.3.1 is good for everyday use.
Future version 0.3.2 is still under testing.
