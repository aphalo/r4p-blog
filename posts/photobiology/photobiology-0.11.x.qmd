::: callout-note

As part of moving the site to Quarto I intend to write a single post to give an
overview of changes in minor versions of the packages. In this case, all
versions in the 0.11.x series. I will update this same post in the case of minor
version updates, and start a new post when I release the first version in the
0.12.x series. I hope this will reduce the clutter and still provide a good
overview of progress. Differences between versions are listed in detail in the
[NEWS file](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/photobiology/news/).

## Overview of changes

_Version 0.11.0_ makes operations on objects containing multiple spectra in long
form in most cases equivalent to operations on collections of spectra. This
allows the use of simpler code and improves consistency of handling among the
different supported ways of storing spectral data.
