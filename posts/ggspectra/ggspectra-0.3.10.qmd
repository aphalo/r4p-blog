This update to 'ggspectra' tracks changes in 'photobiology' 0.10.15, 'photobiologyWavebands' 0.5.1 and 'ggplot2' 3.4.0, as well as in R 4.1.0. These are mostly deprecations that would trigger warnings. Please, be aware that these versions or later are now required.

[The corrected definition of `PAR()` in 'photobiologyWavebands' 0.5.1 is code breaking as this change will cause some plots, especially annotations in them to change, when `PAR()` has been explicitly called in users' code for quantities that are not photon based, in most cases with a warning.]{style="background-color: #ffff99;"}

New *x* scales and new functions for adding secondary *x* axes have been implemented.

**Version 0.3.10:**
-   Track bug fix in 'photobiologyWavebands', that updated the definition of `PAR()` (photosynthetically active radiation) as a BSWF (biological spectral weighting function). The previous definition of `PAR()` as a wavelength range returned a value that can be called "PAR" only when used to compute photon irradiance or photon exposure. This change does not affect the numerical values of energy irradiances or other spectral quantities when using `autoplot()` with the default `w.band` argument, but now the waveband is labelled **PhR** instead of **PAR** in such cases
-   Add `sec_axis_energy_eV()` and `sec_axis_energy_J()` to express wavelength as energy per photon, and `sec_axis_wl()` to allow a secondary wavelength axis with wavelengths expressed using a different scale factor than in the main axis.
-   Add scales `scale_x_wavenumber_continuous()`, `scale_x_frequency_continuous()`, `scale_x_energy_eV_continuous()` and `scale_x_energy_J_continuous()`.

**Version 0.3.11:**
-  Bug fixes to `autoplot()` methods.

**Version 0.3.12:**
-  Improve `autoplot()` methods. Formatting of numbers in labels and handling
of `ylim` arguments that subset the data.

**Version 0.3.13:**
- Bug fixes. 
- Improve `autoplot()` methods, and fully support multiple spectra in long
form.

```{r}
library(ggspectra)
autoplot(sun_evening.spct, unit.out = "photon")
```
