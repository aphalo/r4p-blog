**I have moved this website from WordPress to [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).**
The address <https://www.r4photobiology.info/> remains unchanged.

I have migrated only part of the content from the old site. In particular I
have not migrated package update announcements as they mostly repeated the
contents of the NEWS file of each package, which contains the whole history.
I have converted some posts that I consider of long-term interest into pages.
I am building a whole new section of galleries of example plots with code
demonstrating the use of, at the moment, packages 'ggpp' and 'ggpmisc'. The
galleries have some new material together with examples copied or adapted from 
the packages' documentation but organized in a way that should make them easier
to find.

_Note: The date of this post is set to the current one, to keep it at the top._
