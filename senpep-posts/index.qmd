My first website about plant photobiology started around 1997 or so. That is
27 years ago! It was written manually in a text editor and later using an HTML
editor. In 2009 I started using the Wordpress server of the University of
Helsinki, my employer. I will retire soon, so I started today moving this
website to Quarto and a new URL. As with my other sites, I will be selective,
and transfer only posts that remain of some interest, and when needed I will
update also the content. There are 115 posts to check and fewer to transfer.

2024-07-13: Done 2023 to 2020, skipping some posts, of which one I will update and move.
