I recently visited Universidad Austral de Chile (UACh) located i n Valdivia. This trip is part of a colaboration with Daniel Calderini in a project about responses of wheat to planting density. My contribution is related to light quality in wheat canopies with plants at different spacing.

I also taught an intensive doctoral course titled "Ecología sensorial de plantas y aclimatación" and gave a seminar "Usando R en fotobiología".
