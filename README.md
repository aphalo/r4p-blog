Web site sources using [Quarto](https://quarto.org).

The rendered website is published at [https://www.r4photobiology.info/static](https://www.r4photobiology.info/static) and will soon replace the WordPress based 
site at [https://www.r4photobiology.info/](https://www.r4photobiology.info/).

The transfer is rather painless but time consuming, at least when done by copy and paste between the classic editor in WordPress and RStudio.
