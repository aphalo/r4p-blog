## R, data analysis and photobiology

This website's focuses mostly on methodology and R and R packages as tools. It complements R packages and books I have authored. The site emphasizes the use of the R packages I have developed, both extensions to 'ggplot2' and a suite of several R packages supporting computations, data acquisition and plotting related to photobiology. However, it also includes some content broadly applicable to data analysis and data visualization.

## Contents

The following sections of the site can be accessed through the menu at the top
of the screen.

### Blog

The [blog](posts.qmd) contains short articles, mostly news that once published
are not revised, except for mistakes.

### Pages

The [pages](pages.qmd) are informative articles and tutorials that once published
are updated as needed to keep them useful and relevant.

### R Gallery

The [R gallery](galleries.qmd) are pages that demonstrate use cases of R and R
packages, mostly my own packages. Each page contains multiple R-code recipes for ploting and
computations for specific tasks, cookbook style. The aim is to provide
additional recipes complementing those in the well known 
[Cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/) website. Once published they are updated as needed to keep
them useful and relevant, and possibly to expand them.

### R packages

This menu entry gives access to the documentation in HTML format for all the R packages that
I actively maintain. It also lists a page that summarizes the results of the latest test runs at
CRAN and GitHub and links for reporting bugs or requesting support.

### Books

This menu entry gives access to pages related to books I have written or edited about R and/or photobiology.

### About

Pages with additional information about the site and its webmaster and author.

## My websites

I have been using and teaching [R](https://www.r-project.org/), the free software environment for statistical computing and graphics, for more than 20 years. I am a researcher working in the field of sensory ecology of plants. I have been interested throughout my carreer in plants' responses to light.

In my research group we have used R for general data analysis, as well as for plotting and calculations related to photobiology. As a result of all these activities I developed several R packages and published them through CRAN. I have also written books both on R and on photobiology. 

I have a [separate website for my research group's activities]() and a [website with material related to photography and photography techniques](). My scientific publications are listed at my [ORCID profile](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3385-972X).

I published my first website, _The Plant Photobiology Notes_, between 1995 and 2001. It survived with minor updates until around 2009, with a couple of changes in its URL. Much its contents are outdated but [the site was archived by the Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://cc.joensuu.fi/photobio*) and remains available. Much of the same spectral data are now included in my R packages.
