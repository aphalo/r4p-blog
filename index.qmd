## News and announcements

I publish announcements through Mastodon. I use [hashes to differentiate
posts by subject](posts/Mastodon-updates/index.qmd) so that you can
follow what you are interested in without cluttering your Mastodon Home.
You can see my first post through Mastodon or [my first
*toot*](https://mastodon.social/@aphalo/110389057352585332).

## R, data analysis and photobiology

This website's focuses mostly on methodology, and R and R packages as
tools. It complements R packages and books I have authored. The site
emphasizes the use of the R packages I have developed and maintain,
including extensions to 'ggplot2' and a suite of several R packages
supporting computations, data acquisition and plotting related to
photobiology. However, this website also includes some content broadly
applicable to data analysis and data visualization.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ggspectra)
photon_as_default()
autoplot(sun.daily.spct, annotations = c("+", "title:where:when"))
```

## Contents

The following sections of the site can be accessed through the menu at
the top of the screen.

### Blog

The [blog](posts.qmd) contains short articles, mostly news that once
published are not revised, except for mistakes.

### Pages

The [pages](pages.qmd) are informative articles and tutorials that once
published are updated as needed to keep them useful and relevant.

### R Gallery

The [R gallery](galleries.qmd) are pages that demonstrate use cases of R
and R packages, mostly my own packages. Each page contains multiple
R-code recipes for ploting and computations for specific tasks, cookbook
style. The aim is to provide additional recipes complementing those in
the well known [Cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/) website.
Once published they are updated as needed to keep them useful and
relevant, and possibly to expand them.

### R packages

This menu entry gives access to the documentation in HTML format for all
the R packages that I actively maintain. It also lists a page that
summarizes the results of the latest test runs at CRAN and GitHub and
links for reporting bugs or requesting support.

### Books

This menu entry gives access to pages related to books I have written or
edited about R and/or photobiology.

### About

Pages with additional information about the site and its webmaster and
author.

## My websites

I have been using and teaching [R](https://www.r-project.org/), the free
software environment for statistical computing and graphics, for more
than 20 years. I am a researcher working in the field of sensory ecology
of plants. I have been interested throughout my carreer in plants'
responses to light.

In my research group we have used R for general data analysis, as well
as for plotting and calculations related to photobiology. As a result of
all these activities I developed several R packages and published them
through CRAN. I have also written books both on R and on photobiology.

I have a [separate website for my research group's activities]() and a
[website with material related to photography and photography
techniques](). My scientific publications are listed at my [ORCID
profile](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3385-972X).

I published my first website, *The Plant Photobiology Notes*, between
1995 and 2001. Initially it was hosted in the desktop PC in my office,
the same I used everyday for other tasks. The site survived with minor
updates, mostly deletion of broken links, until around 2009. In the
meantime the URL changed two or three times when I changed jobs. Much of
its contents are now outdated but [the site was archived by the Wayback
Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://cc.joensuu.fi/photobio*)
and remains available. Most of the spectral data at the old site are now
included in my R packages together with newer data.
