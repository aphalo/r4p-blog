  abstract = {Recent molecular and physiological studies have demonstrated that {ultraviolet-B} radiation {(UV-B)} can affect some of the processes involved in leaf growth, but the phases of leaf growth affected have not been clearly delimited. We used functional growth analysis to assess the effects of {UV-B} radiation on the time course of leaf growth in seedlings of two birch species {(Betula} pendula and Betula pubescens). Our aim was to identify the phase(s) of leaf development affected by {UV-B} radiation. In a greenhouse study, 1-year-old birch seedlings were subjected to three daily doses of supplemental {UV-B} radiation treatments {(UV-B⁺)} and no {UV-B} radiation controls {(UV-B⁻).} Leaf growth measurements every 2 days were complemented by assessment of other functional traits over a 4-week period at the start of the growing season. Using fitted curves, we were able to determine that the rate of leaf expansion was slowed by the {UV-B⁺} treatment in leaves of B. pendula because of a slower maximum leaf growth rate compared with plants under the {UV-B⁻} controls, but that compensation toward the end of the period of expansion negated this difference when leaves reached their final size. {UV-B⁺} had little effect on the rate of B. pubescens leaf growth despite a larger reduction in leaf final size due to {UV-B⁺} than occurred in B. pendula leaves. In conclusion, effective regulation ameliorated the effects of {UV-B} radiation on leaf and seedling growth in B. pendula, whereas in B. pubescens, reductions in leaf final size under {UV-B⁺} were consistent with a slightly reduced rate of height growth.},
