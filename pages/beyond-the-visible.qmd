Preview and/or download the handbook at [Google books](https://www.google.fi/books/edition/Beyond_the_Visible/S8LdnstG5G4C?hl=en&gbpv=0) where you can also search the whole contents.

The printed version of the handbook is available for purchase at (http://www.amazon.co.uk/) and other Amazon sites. CreateSpace no longer exists, and Amazon is charging a much higher price for the printed version than when originally published. So, it may be wiser to get the free PDF and print the pages you need. There are preliminary plans for a 2nd edition to be published in 2024 or 2025.

Contents:

  1. Introduction
  2. Manipulating UV Radiation
  3. Quantifying UV Radiation
  4. Plant Growing Conditions
  5. Statistical Design of UV Experiments
