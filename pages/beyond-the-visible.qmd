Preview and/or download the handbook in Google books where you can also search the whole contents.

The printed version of the handbook is available for purchase at (http://www.amazon.co.uk/) and other Amazon sites. CreateSpace no longer exists, and Amazon is charging a much higher price for the printed version than when originally published. So, it may be wiser to get the free PDF and print the pages you need. There plans for a 2nd edition to be published in a year or two.
