This page lists all the R package I maintain and have authored. Those packages with a green CRAN badge are available from this repository, which is known by R by default. The sources are maintained in public Git repositories. Git is a _revision control system_ that is used to keep track of changes made to the package R code and its documentation. Until very recently, the public repositories have been hosted at Bitbucket. I am currently migrating them to GitHub. The reason is that at GitHub it is nowadays extremely easy to set up automated code tests under different R versions and operating systems (Windows, Linux and OS X).

The README for the packages includes information on where the Git repository is hosted. Once automatic tests are set up, I add an additional badge for these tests to the README. A passed GitHub badge means that the development version is passing all tests and safe to install directly from GitHub.

The badges displayed below in order from left to right inform of: most recent version available in CRAN and its date, downloads per week from CRAN, downloads since first availability through CRAN, worst result from CRAN checks on different R versions under different operating systems, and number of open issues at each Git repository. All badges are linked to pages with further information.

CRAN checks are run regularly and may fail after a package is accepted in CRAN as a result of changes to other packages or R itself. NOTEs can generally be ignored in-between package releases, while WARNings, and ERRORs I attempt correct as soon as I notice them.

Issues at a Git repository can be raised by the developer as a TO DO list or by any user to report problems or suggest enhancements. The urgency with which issues need to be dealt with varies and consequently that there are open issues pending of resolution is normal in practice. The 'issues' badge is linked to the issues page at each Git repository through which it is possible to create new issues. All the packages are open-source and released under GPL.

## Extensions to 'ggplot2' (3 packages)
