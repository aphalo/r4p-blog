The site RefractiveIndex.info is an interface to a public domain
database of refractive index data for many substances and materials.
What makes it very useful is that the website calculates properties like
reflectance at different angles and wavelengths interactively and
displays the data as plots.

Manybe sometime in the far away future I will write an R interface.
The web site as is, can be instructive for example to learn how the
reflectance of glass or acrylic changes with the angle of incidence of
radiation.
