  Shiny Apps or dashboards for interactive exploration on the dependence of the t and F distributions on the degrees of freedom.

Three Apps or dashboards created with R package [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/). It takes a few moments to activate the Apps in the server as they are stopped after 10 min without user interaction. 

_At the moment I have a free account of the hosting service. If the free quota is used up and the Apps stop working, please contact me, and I will buy additional computing time._

# _t_-distribution compared to the Normal distribution

As the number of degrees of freedom increases the _t_ distribution approaches the Normal distribution.

The observed _t_-value is calculated as ${\bar x} / s_{\bar x}$, or more generaly the estimate of the value of a parameter divided by its standard deviation.

# _F_-distribution

The observed _F_-value is the ratio between two estimates of variance $s^2_1 / s^2_2$. If the variance as numerator is larger than the denominator $F > 1$. The degrees of freedom of the two variances determine the shape of the distribution.

[_F_-distribution App](https://aphalo.shinyapps.io/F-distribution/)

If we know the observed _F_-value, and degrees of freedom we can look up the _P_-value from the theoretical distribution.
