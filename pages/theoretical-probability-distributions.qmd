  Shiny Apps or dashboards for interactive explorartion on the dependence of the t and F distributions on the degrees of freedom.

Three Apps or dashboards created with R package [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/). It takes a few moments to activate the Apps in the server as they are stopped after 10 min without user interaction. 

_At the moment I have a free account of the hosting service. If the free quota is used up and the Apps stop working, please contact me, and I will buy additional computing time._
