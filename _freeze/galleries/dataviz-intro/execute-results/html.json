I will keep the focus in this class much broader, away from the nitty-gritty details and focusing on the different types of plots that can be created. Putting more emphasis on the properties of the data than in their origin, and also considering the aims that we may have when plotting data.\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-warning}\n## Package 'ggpp' version\n\n**Examples make use of an updated version of package 'ggpp' (future version 0.5.5), now available from CRAN.**\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (packageVersion(\"ggpp\") < \"0.5.5\") {\n  cat(\"Please, update package 'ggpp' before running the code examples.\")\n}\nif (packageVersion(\"ggpmisc\") < \"0.5.4\") {\n  cat(\"Please, update package 'ggpmisc' before running the code examples.\")\n}\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\nAll the figures in this page have been created with R and packages 'ggplot2',\n'ggpmisc', 'ggbeeswarm' and 'ggdensity'.

The difference among plots prepared for different purposes and audiences is mainly in the degree of complexity that can be expected to be understandable and in how aesthetically polished is the plot is.\n\n:::{.callout-attention}\nWhen we prepare a text for publication we spend time in planing how to best communicate our message, then in writing a draft, and in revising this draft, usually several times, until it is ready for submission. The same approach is the best also when producing plots for publication.\n\nAs with text, asking other people to study and comment on the figures we create is important. A well designed data visualization can make the difference in the impact (number of times cited) of a publication.\n:::\n\n## Continuous and discrete variables\n\nSome variables are inherently discontinuous, such as counts. For example, number of germinated seeds, number of plants of a given species present in plot, etc. Other variables are inherently continuous, like temperature. Even if temperature is continuous, if we grow a group of plants at 16 C and another group at 21 C, we force temperature to behave as discrete.\n\n## Plotting data summaries\n\nMeans, trimmed means, medians, standard errors, standard deviations, variances, linear regressions, non-linear regressions, quantile regression, smoothing splines, interpolating splines, empirical density functions in 1D or 2D.\n\n## Annotations and data labels\n\nAnnotations and data labels can be text, icons, small plots, small tables, etc. The difference is that annotations refer to the whole plot and data labels to individual observations, or individualy plotted summaries.\n\n## Number of observations\n\nDifferent types of plots are suitable depending on the number of observations. We can plot individual observations up to a point. In all cases we need to make sure that if we plot individual observations they are all visible. The number of observations and how clumped together they are can be decisive when chosing the type of plot or data visualization to use.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nWith few observations a _dot plot_, or variations using _jitter_ to prevent overlaps, work usually very well. With more than 10-15 observations a _boxplot_ or _beeswarm plot_ can be used and is usually preferable. With 20 or more observations a _violin plot_ can be good. These are all \"rules of thumb\" that need to be adjusted using common sense based on how the values are grouped and how they may overlap.\n:::\n\n# Examples\n\n## Growth of orange trees\n\nData set `Orange`, included in R, contains growth measurements on five orange trees. It contains a continuous response variable (trunk circumference) and one continuous explanatory variable (date). (See `help(Orange)` in R for additional details.)\n\n### Scatter plot\n\nIn this case it is clear which of the variables should be mapped to _x_ and _y_.\n\nHere we plot observations for each tree individually. This emphasizes the differences among trees. These are repeated measurements on the same trees, but even with a different point _shape_ for each tree, it is rather difficult to assess growth, which is the most interesting feature of the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(Orange)\nmy.Orange <- Orange\nmy.Orange$Tree <- factor(as.character(my.Orange$Tree)) # silence warning\nmy.Orange$Date <- ymd(\"1968/12/31\") + days(my.Orange$age)\n\nggplot(my.Orange, \n       aes(x = Date, y = circumference, \n           shape = Tree, linetype = Tree)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  expand_limits(y = 0) +\n  labs(y = \"Trunk circumference (mm)\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](dataviz-intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.svg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Line plot\n\nHere we connect observations with lines.

Which of the plots above do you think is most informative?\n2. Which of the plots would you prefer to see in a talk?\n3. Which of the plots would be best for a scientific article?`\n4. Can you think of a better design, maybe combining features from the different plots? (First decide what feature of the data you will emphasize.)\n:::\n\n## Height of birch seedlings\n\nTime ago in an experiment we measured a large number of tree seedlings. This data set contrasts with the one used above. While above we had data for five trees, here we have data for 350 one-summer-old tree seedlings. Measurements are all at a single time point, but different groups of seedlings were grown under different conditions. The data set is included in R package 'ggpp' (>= 0.5.5).\n\n### Dot plot\n\nA simple dot plot cannot contain many observations before points start overlapping. The plot below, even when using transparency, is nearly impossible to read usefully.-\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(birch.df, \n       aes(y = height, x = Density)) +\n  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE, alpha = 0.15) +\n  facet_wrap(facets = vars(Container), labeller = label_both) +\n  labs(y = \"Height (cm)\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](dataviz-intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.svg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAdding _jitter_ we randomly spread the points sideways, which helps prevent the majority of the overlaps. However, as we will see below, this works rather well, but there are other options that can make the information easier to read from the plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(birch.df, \n       aes(y = height, x = Density)) +\n  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE, alpha = 0.33, position = position_jitter(width = 0.3)) +\n  facet_wrap(facets = vars(Container), labeller = label_both) +\n  labs(y = \"Height (cm)\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](dataviz-intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.svg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Plots of means and CL\n\nIn publications plots like the one below are rather common. They are easy to read, but discard quite a lot of information. Confidence limits, computed in the usual way, are informative as long as the distribution is symmetrical and close to the Normal. In this case we use _P_ = 0.95, so we read these bars as indicating that there is a high probability that the true (whole-population) mean height falls within the boundaries of the bars.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(birch.df, aes(y = height, x = Container)) +\n  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_normal, na.rm = TRUE) +\n  expand_limits(y = 60) +\n  stat_group_counts(npcx = c(1/4, 3/4), npcy = 0.05, na.rm = TRUE) +\n  labs(y = \"Height (cm)\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](dataviz-intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.svg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the plot above the height scale starts at 60 cm. Most members of the scientific community can be excepted, at least if given enough time, to read the plot correctly. In contrast, the general public in many countries is likely to misinterpret a plot like this getting the impression that there is a huge difference in height btween the two groups of seedlings. So, even if it leaves a lot empty white space, the version of the plot with the _y_ axis starting at zero can be preferable.\n\nThe first impression is very different, even for someone experienced. The CLs that looked quite large now look tiny. Of course if we use the axis scale, we realize in both cases that the whole range of the CLs is about 3 cm.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(birch.df, aes(y = height, x = Container)) +\n  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_boot, na.rm = TRUE) +\n  expand_limits(y = 0) +\n  stat_group_counts(npcx = c(1/4, 3/4), npcy = 0.05, na.rm = TRUE) +\n  labs(y = \"Height (cm)\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](dataviz-intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.svg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nEven more common than CLs for error bars (in black) is plotting of standard errors as error bars (in blue).

In general in recent years there has been an increase in the use of more informative data visualizations in scientific research, in part because of the more widespread recognition of the weaknesses of showing only means and error bars, but also because the plotting of data in more elaborate ways has become easier with increasingly powerful computers and free software like R. \n\nWe next look at histograms, which have been in use for a very long time, and have different limitations.\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\nThe `birch.df` data set included in R package 'ggpp' contains additional variables than those plotted above.\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n### Questions to think about\n\nThe plots above mainly describe the position of the center of the data, and a summary version of the variation.\n\n1.

(First decide what feature of the data you will emphasize.)\n:::\n\n### Histogram\n\nAlthough histograms are usually plotted as columns, they are very different to the column plots above. In an histogram the columns do not represent summaries of a measured variable individually, they describe the absolute number (or the relative number) of observations within different ranges of values of the measured variable.\n\nA histogram in this case provides a simple way of describing the number of seedlings within each size _bin_ or range of heights. From this figure we can read that the largest number of seedlings are about 75 cm tall. We can also see that the shape is asymmetrical with more very short seedlings than very tall ones.\n\n**A \"meaningful\" box blot can only be created from a fairly large number of replicate observations.**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(birch.df, aes(x = height)) +\n  stat_bin(binwidth = 5, na.rm = TRUE, fill = \"grey50\") +\n  stat_group_counts(na.rm = TRUE) +\n  labs(x = \"Height (cm)\", y = \"Number of seedlings\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](dataviz-intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.svg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBy changing `color` and `fill` we can emphasize the _bins_ used for counting the observations.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(birch.df, aes(x = height)) +\n  stat_bin(binwidth = 5, na.rm = TRUE, fill = \"grey90\", color = \"black\") +\n  stat_group_counts(na.rm = TRUE) +\n  labs(x = \"Height (cm)\", y = \"Number of seedlings\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](dataviz-intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.svg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTwo different kinds of histograms can be created.

The thick line in the middle is the median, and the ends of the box the quatiles. In other words in the plot below, half of the observation are above the median and half of them below. In addition half of the observations fall within the range of height delimited by the box. The whiskers, in the absence of _outliers_, give the range of the whole data set. There are different ways determining which observations are \"unusual\", one is making the whiskers at most 1.5 times the size of the box, and showing the outliers as points.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(birch.df, aes(y = height, x = Container)) +\n  stat_boxplot(na.rm = TRUE, width = 0.3, fill = \"grey95\") +\n  labs(y = \"Height (cm)\", y = \"Number of seedlings\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](dataviz-intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-32-1.svg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the plot above all outliers are small and the lower whisker is longer than the upper one.

This advantage has been made irrelevant by modern computers. However, they remain a useful approach when the number of observations is rather large.\n\n**Take home message:** Boxplots are in my opinion frequently misused when simple dot plots would be more informative.\n:::\n\n### Density plot\n\nWe plotted above a histogram using density.
