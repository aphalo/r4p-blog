Aphalo\"\ndate: 2022-06-15\ndate-modified: 2022-06-15\ncategories: [R Package Update]\nkeywords: [ggpmisc pkg]\n---\n\n\nVersion 0.4.7 brings a fix for a bug that could prevent the use of weights passed through <em>aesthetic</em> `weight` in some of the model-fitting statistics. Several enhancements to the model fitting statistics make it easier to fit different models to different groups or panels, and make it possible/easier to select among methods supported by a model fit function.\n\nHere is a simple example of fitting different models to different panels. Instead of using `lm()` as method, we define a wrapper function that tests for the significance of the slope in linear regression, and if not significant, fits the mean instead.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggpmisc)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npoly_or_mean <- function(formula, data, ...) {\n  mf <- lm(formula = formula, data = data, ...)\n  if (anova(mf)[[\"Pr(>F)\"]][1] > 0.1) {\n    lm(formula = y ~ 1, data = data, ...)\n  } else {\n    mf\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe pass the name of this function as argument to `method` overriding the default argument `\"lm\"`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  stat_poly_line(method = \"poly_or_mean\") +\n  stat_poly_eq(method = poly_or_mean,\n               aes(label = after_stat(eq.label)),\n               label.x = \"right\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  facet_wrap(~class, ncol = 4)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggpmisc-0.4.7_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.svg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhich produces the figure above, showing the mean in panels <strong>2seater</strong> and <strong>minivan</strong>, and a linear regression in others.\n\n<strong>Aditional examples are available in the free <a href=\"https://www.learnr-book.info/learn-r-extra-web.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">supplementary chapters</a> of my book <a href=\"https://www.learnr-book.info/\"><em>Learn R: As </em><em>a</em><em> Language</em></a><em>.</em></strong>\n\nChanges compared to version <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">0.4.6</span>, the previous version in<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"> CRAN</span> are:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Fix bug in the handling of the `weight` aesthetic in some of the model fitting statistics.</li>\n \t<li>The model formula is in calls to `stat_poly_eq()` and `stat_quant_eq()` now retrieved from the returned fitted model object.
