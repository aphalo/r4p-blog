Aphalo\"\ndate: 2022-08-05\ndate-modified: 2024-04-07\ncategories: [R Package Update]\nkeywords: [ggpmisc pkg]\n---\n\n\n::: callout-note\n\nAs part of moving the site to Quarto I intend to write a single post to give an\noverview of changes in minor versions of the packages. In this case, all\nversions in the 0.5.x series. I will update this same post in the case of minor\nversion updates, and start a new post when I release the first version in the\n0.6.x series. I hope this will reduce the clutter and still provide a good\noverview of progress. Differences between versions are listed in detail in the\n[NEWS file](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/ggpmisc/news/).\n\n:::\n\n## Overview of changes\n\n_Version 0.5.0_ brings several enhancements to the annotations based on model fits. The most visible change is the new convenience function `use_label()` that greatly simplifies the assembly of labels from components and their mapping to aesthetics. I exemplify its use and some of the other new features below in section **Examples**. Several of the model-fit based statistics now return on request additional variables in `data` adding flexibility. Function `stat_correlation()` now computes confidence intervals for correlation estimates. New functions `keep_tidy()`, `keep_glance()` and `keep_augment()` are wrappers on methods `tidy()`, `glance()` and `augment()` from package 'broom'. These new functions make it possible to keep a trace of the origin of the _\"broom-tidied\"_ outputs similalrly as it is possible with `\"lm\"` objects and other objects returned by R's model fitting functions.\n\n_Version 0.5.1_ brings additional enhancements to the annotations based on model fits to improve traceability. New scales `scale_colour_logFC()`, `scale_color_logFC()` and `scale_fill_logFC()` and revised `scale_colour_outcome()` and `scale_fill_outcome()` add flexibility.\n\n_Version 0.5.2_ fixes bugs and ensures compatibility with updates to 'ggplot2' and 'lubridate'. \n\n_Version 0.5.3_ fixes bugs, brings compatibility with package 'gganimate' and adds parameter `n.min` to all statistics that are based on model fitting or correlation testing functions. Arguments passed to `n.min` make it possible to increase the previously hard-coded limit that remains in most cases as the default.\n\n_Version 0.5.4_ brings `stat_multcomp()` for computing multiple comparisons within the framework of _general linear hypothesis_ as implemented in R package 'multcomp' and annotation of plots with the outcomes.\n\n_Version 0.5.5_ fixes bug that prevented use of model formulas with a transformation in the _lhs_, such as use of `I()` or other functions instead of bare `y` or `x`.\n\n_Version 0.5.6_ fixes bugs and implements enhancements to `stat_multcomp()` and tracks changes in 'ggplot2' >= 3.5.0. **Depends directly on 'ggpp' >= 0.5.7, and indirectly on 'ggplot2' >= 3.5.0.**\n\n## Examples\n\nIn this section I demonstrate the use of some of the new features described above.\n\nIn the first plot I add an estimate of the correlation coefficient _R_, and the corresponding _t_-value and _P_-value.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggpmisc)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(subset(mpg, cyl != 5), aes(displ, hwy, colour = factor(cyl))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  stat_correlation(use_label(c(\"R\", \"t\", \"P\")),\n                   label.x = \"right\") +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggpmisc-0.5.x_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.svg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe displacement volume of car engines is known without error and it can the thought as a possible explanation for the petrol use per distance (MPG or miles per gallon) for highway driving. I fit a linear regression per group, and annotate the plot with the fitted linear model equations, _F_-values and _P_-values.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(subset(mpg, cyl != 5), aes(displ, hwy, colour = factor(cyl))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  stat_poly_line() +\n  stat_poly_eq(use_label(c(\"eq\", \"F\", \"P\")),\n                   label.x = \"right\") +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggpmisc-0.5.x_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.svg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the case of the petrol use (MPG) in city traffic compared to highway travel the two variables can be expected to be subject to similar error variation and there is no directional cause-effect relationship between them. So, in this case OLS linear regression is not a suitable approach. We use major axis regression instead, and we add to the label, Î¸, the angle in degrees between the two lines that could have been fitted by linear regression using _x_ or _y_ as the explanatory variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(subset(mpg, cyl != 5), aes(cty, hwy)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +\n  stat_ma_line() +\n  stat_ma_eq(use_label(c(\"eq\", \"theta\", \"R2\", \"P\"))) +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggpmisc-0.5.x_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.svg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\nMultiple comparisons can be used, for example to test for differences among cars with engines with different numbers of\ncylinders.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(subset(mpg, cyl != 5), aes(factor(cyl), hwy)) +\n  geom_violin() +\n  stat_multcomp() +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggpmisc-0.5.x_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.svg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n[*Documentation web site*](http://docs.r4photobiology.info/ggpmisc/) includes all help pages, with output from all examples and vignettes in HTML format .\n\nPlease raise issues concerning bugs or enhancements to this package through GitHub at <https://github.com/aphalo/ggpmisc/issues>.
