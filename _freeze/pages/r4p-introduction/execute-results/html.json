The accompanying packages provide\ndata and definitions that are to a large extent application-area\nspecific while the functions in the package 'photobiology' are widely\nuseful in photobiology and in radiation quantification in geophysics and\nmeteorology. Package 'photobiology' has its main focus in the\ncharacterization of the light environment in a biologically relevant\nmanner and in the manipulation of spectral data to simulate\nphoto-physical, photo-chemical and photo-biological interactions and\nresponses. In addition it implements the algorithms of Jean Meeus for\nthe position of the sun, as this and derived quantities like day- and\nnight length are important for most organisms.\n\nData exchange with packages 'pavo', 'colorSpec' and 'hyperSpec' is\nsupported. The focus of package 'pavo' (Maia et al. 2003) is on color\nperception by animals and assessment of animal coloration. The focus of\npackage 'colorSpec' (Davis 2019) is on color-related computations:\n\"Calculate with spectral properties of light sources, materials,\ncameras, eyes, and scanners.\" The focus of package 'hyperSpec' (Beleites\nand Sergo) is the handling of hyperspectral data sets, such as spectral\nimages and time series of spectra.\n\nBecause of their different focus, these packages mostly complement each\nother, in spite of some overlap and differences in approach or even, in\nphilosophy about data handling.'\n\n## Packages in the suite\n\nThe core package in this suite is called\n['**photobiology**'](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/photobiology/) and\nall other packages in the suite depend on it. Other specialized packages\nfor quantification of ultraviolet-, visible- and infra-red radiation\n(['**photobiologyWavebands**'](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/photobiologyWavebands/)),\nproperties of plant photoreceptors and other plant photobiology related\ncalculations\n(['**photobiologyPlants**'](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/photobiologyPlants/)),\nexample spectral data for filters and objects\n(['**photobiologyFilters**'](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/photobiologyFilters/)),\nlamps\n(['**photobiologyLamps**'](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/photobiologyLamps/)),\nLEDs\n(['**photobiologyLEDs**'](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/photobiologyLEDs/)),\nsunlight\n(['**photobiologySun**'](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/photobiologySun/)),\nlight sensors\n(['**photobiologySensors**'](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/photobiologySensors/))\nand for exchange of data in *foreign* formats\n(['**photobiologyInOut**'](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/photobiologyInOut/))\nare part of the suite. One additional package,\n(['**ggspectra**'](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/ggspectra/)),\nimplements facilities for plotting spectral data by extending package\n'ggplot2'. Two additional packages\n(['**rOmniDriver**'](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/rOmniDriver/)) and\n(['**ooacquire**'](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/ooacquire/)) make it\npossible to acquire spectral data by controlling *Ocean Insight/Ocean\nOptics* spectrometers from within R.\n\n| Package                     | Provides                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| 'photobiology'              | Core classes, methods and functions                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| 'photobiologyWavebands'     | Definitions of standardized and frequently used wavelength band definitions and spectral weighting functions.                                                                                           |\n| 'photobiologyPlants'        | Methods, functions and data for plants and vegetation.                                                                                                                                                  |\n| 'photobiologyInOut'         | Exchange of data within R and using different proprietary and standard-based formats.                                                                                                                   |\n| 'photobiologyLamps'         | Spectral emission and other data for various lamp types.                                                                                                                                                |\n| 'photobiologyLEDs'          | Spectral emission and other data for various LEDs and LED arrays.                                                                                                                                       |\n| 'photobiologySensors'       | Spectral response and other data for various UV, VIS and NIR sensors.                                                                                                                                   |\n| 'photobiologySun'           | Spectral irradiance and other data for sunlight.

COST Action FA9604 'UV4Growth' facilitated\ndiscussions and exchanges of ideas that lead to the development of this\npackage. The contributions of Andy McLeod, Lars Olof Björn, Nigel Paul,\nLasse Ylianttila, Glen Davis, Agnese Fazio, T. Matthew Robson and Titta\nKotilainen were specially significant. Other members of the UV4Plants\nAssociation (<https://www.uv4plants.org/>) and participants in workshops\nand training events contributed both problems in need of being solved\nand solutions to implement.\n\nTutorials by Hadley Wickham and comments on my presentation at\n*UseR!2015* allowed me to significantly improve the coding and\nfunctionality. The generous on-line help by many members of the R\ncommunity over more than 20 years is also warmly thanked.\n\n### Reference for the suite\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(citation(\"photobiology\"), style = \"textVersion\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nAphalo, Pedro J.
