The probe both delivers the excitation and collects the radiation to\nbe measured. For measurements the probe was set normal to the measured surface.\n\n::: callout-note\nAcquisition of all quantitative spectral data requires that the spectrometer has\nbeen calibrated for wavelength. In addition the dose response must have been\nmeasured and a linearization function obtained. On the other hand, unlike\nirradiance or fluorescence, measurement of reflectance and transmittance are\nindenpendent of the wavelength sensitivity of array pixels because reference and\ntarget values needed to compute a reflectance or transmittance as a ratio are\nmeasured by the same pixel in the detector array. Fluorescence is normally\nemitted at a longer wavelength than the excitation, and consequently an internal\nreference is lacking.\n:::\n\nAs excitation sources I used 5 mm LEDs powered by a \"Compact handheld LED\nTester\" from Roithner-Laser or an identical one from Lumitronix. I used two\ndifferent LEDs types in 5 mm clear epoxy packages: LED405-05V (maximum rated\nradiant power 15 mW and a beam angle of 100 degrees) and RLS-UV380 (maximum\nrated radiant power 20 mW and a beam angle of 20 degrees), both supplied by\nRoithner LaserTechnik. The LEDs were driving by a DC current of 20 mA to 25 mA.\n\nAs a \"white\" high reflectance and non-fluorescing reference I used a 5 mm-thick\nslab of virgin (not-recycled) PTFE. I assumed a reflectance of 90% for this\nreference based on the properties of PTFE.\n\nThe subjects tested were papers I had on my desk: a note pad, an invoice,\npaperback book and a yellow Post-It note.\n\nSpectra were acquired as counts per second (cps) using function\n`acq_irrad_interactive()` from R package\n['ooacquire'](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/ooacquire) version 0.3.2 under [R](https://www.r-project.org/)\nversion 4.3.0. Further calculations relied on R package\n['photobiology'](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/photobiology) version 0.10.16.\nPlots were created with R package\n['ggspectra'](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/ggspectra) version 0.3.11.\n\n::: callout-tip\nIn this page code chunks are \"folded\" so as to decrease the clutter. Above each\nplot you will find a small triangle followed by \"Code\". Clicking on the triangle\n\"unfolds\" the code chunk making visible the R code used to produce the plot. Two\nadditional chunks below are used to attach the packages used and load the data.\nThe code in the chunks can be copied by clicking on the top right corner, where\nan icon appears when the mouse cursor hovers over the code listing.\n:::\n\n## Results\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggspectra)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nload(\"collection.reflectance.fluorescence.Rda\")\n# names(collection.reflectance.fluorescence.cps.mspct)\n```\n:::\n\n### UV-A radiation excitation at 380 nm\n\nThe probe was handheld during measurements so measurements are only approximate.\nOn the other hand differences among surfaces are huge and enough to demonstrate\nthe viability of the approach. \n\nThe area under the reference curve between 360 nm\nand 410 nm is $5\\times 10^{5}$ arbitrary units (@fig-white-reference-380nm).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nautoplot(collection.reflectance.fluorescence.cps.mspct[[26]])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Excitation spectrum measured as reflected from a PTFE slab used as reference.](index_files/figure-html/fig-white-reference-380nm-1.svg){#fig-white-reference-380nm}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe area under the paper curves between 360 nm and 410 nm are $4190$  and $2.82\\times 10^{4}$  arbitrary units  (@fig-white-paper-380nm).

I have yet to test this, but the same approach can be expected to work with LEDs emitting at shorter wavelengths than those tested. Anyway, additional optical power for excitation would be helpful for decreasing noise in spectra measured from dark objects. For wavelengths longer than 365 nm LEDs emitting 10 to 20 times more radiation than those I used are readily available in packages relatively easy to couple to an optical fibre and very cheaply.\n-   When measuring reflectance with a broad spectrum light source, apparent reflectance can be a composite of true reflectance plus fluorescence.\n-   The spectrometer I used is not calibrated for irradiance, so although reflectance was computed from the CPS data, the yield of fluorescence could not be estimated based on the areas under the curves. With a calibrated spectrometer this computation would be possible, but the spectrometer would need to be calibrated with the actual fibre and probe used for the measurements.\n\n",
