I use a lineal model (LM), polynomial regression, as example. I describe the most important values contained in the model fit object returned by function `lm()` and how to extract them. I rely heavily on diagrams and data plots.\n---\n\n\n## Introduction\n\n::: callout-tip\nIn this page some code chunks are \"folded\" so as to decrease the clutter. Above the R\noutput, text or plots, you will find a small triangle followed by \"Code\".\nClicking on the triangle \"unfolds\" the code chunk making visible the R code used\nto produce the output shown.\nThe code in the chunks can be copied by clicking on the top right corner, where\nan icon appears when the mouse cursor hovers over the code listing.\n:::\n\nAttach packages used for plotting.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggpmisc)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(broom)\ntheme_set(theme_bw(16))\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Robust and resistant statistics\n\nIf changing a small part of the body of data, perhaps drastically,\ncan change the value of the summary substantially, the summary is\nnot resistant. Example: the **mean**.\n\nConversely, if a change of a small part of the data, no matter\nwhat part or how much, fails to change the summary\nsubstantially, the summary is said to be _resistant_.\nExample: the **median**.\n\n_Robustness:_ lack of susceptibility to the effects of\nnon-normality.\n\n_Robustness of validity._ example: confidence interval for\nthe population median based on the sign test.\n\n_Robustness of efficiency:_ how much information is\nextracted from the data under different situations.\n\nA robust statistic performs well under different circumstances.\n\n# Robust and resistant regression\n\nRobust regression methods are at least partially resistant to\noutliers, those called resistant methods are even more resistant.\n\nThere are several methods that can be used for robust regression.\n\nThere are also several methods for resistant regression.\n\nIn most cases solutions are calculated by approximation using iterative \nalgorithms.\n\nAs an oversimplification it can be said that these methods assign a\nweight to each observation based on the relationship between an\nassumed distribution of residuals (e.g., Normal) and the empirical observed\ndistribution of residuals.\n\n# Major axis regression\n\nThe example above only demonstrates how different the fitted lines can be, but\nin practice, given the extreme outliers, it does not make sense to assume that\nthey are not exceptional. This does not necessarily mean that we can ignore or\nremove these observations, as they may contain important information, but\npossibly they will need to be studied as separate cases.\n\nWe will use package 'lmodel2' and a different example data set that is a real\nuse case. If you have data from _surveys_ where you want to study relationships\nbetween measured variables that are subject to random variation then OLS linear\nregression is likely to bias the slope estimates. For details read the _vignette_\nthat accompanies 'lmodel2'.\n\n# Quantile regression\n\n\n",
