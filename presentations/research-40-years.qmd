## Presentation roadmap

- Where I come from
- What research I have been doing
- What is my expertise
- What are my skills
- Finding shared interests

## Parallel "lives" as researcher

-  Plants and their environment
-  Research instrumentation
-  Data and computers

These subjects and skills have been intertwined during my whole life, influencing and facilitating each 
other.

Research subjects have varied over 40 years but there has been continuity in the 
development of ideas with some ups and downs.

## It all started in our farm

-  My mother owned a bookshop in Buenos Aires, frequented by writers and academics.
-  My father managed the family farm (mostly cattle) and collaborated in research by INTA, Argentina's "Luke".
-  Exposed as a young boy to research and researchers of several nationalities.
-  As a teenager I was already more interested in crops and farm machinery than in cattle.

## At the university

-  1982: **Ing. Agr.** with focus on crop breeding (Bs. Aires).^[Thesis: "Efectos del stress hídrico y la luz sobre la conductancia foliar de hojas variegadas de _Hedera helix_" (Supervisor Rodolfo A. Sánchez).] 
-  1989: **M. Sc.** in Plant Production (Bs. Aires).^[Thesis: "Valor adaptativo de la modulación de la actividad
de los fotosistemas que controlan la apertura de los estomas: Su evaluación mediante un modelo de
simulación." (Supervisopr Rodolfo A. Sánchez)]
-  1991: **Ph. D.** in Science (Edinburgh).^[Thesis: "Interactions in stomatal function" (supervisor Paul G. Jarvis).]
-  2001: **Dosentti** in Physiological Plant Ecology (Joensuu).

## Jobs in Finland

- 1992-1994: at METLA **Suonenjoki**, working with _Risto Rikala_ and _Hessu Smolander_. I also collaborated with _Elina Vapaavuori_.
- 1995-2001: **Joensuu**, with short-term contracts, at the University of Joensuu and METLA, as well as fellowships (contibuted to "root lab").
- 2001-2006: University of **Jyväskylä**: Lecturer (Yliassistentti) in Environmental Statistics and Metrics.
- 2006-2024: University of **Helsinki**: Lecturer/Senior Lecturer in Physiological Plant Ecology.

## My "historical" research topics

- Most of the research I have lead as PI has related to plants' responses to neighbours/light/shade/UV or to plants' water relations and drought.
- I have contributed to research in other subjects: mineral nutrition, mycorrhizas, agronomy, forestry, economy, and even fish parasites. Collaborators: Tarja Lehto, Tapani Repo, Lena Finer.
- I have published research articles, reviews, chapters, books and also data sets and software.

## Current research focus

- Preemptive acclimation to drought: theoretical framework, environmental cues and response mechanisms.
- Functions of **UVR8** and **CRY**, the UV photoreceptors, in day/sunlight vs. controlled environments.
- Plants' responses (growth, morphology, phenolics) to fluctuating visible light and UV radiation.
- Theory: the definitions of _stress_ and _strain_ and their scaling up from plant-parts to communities.

## Light and weather measurements

- 2021-: soil water and temperature profile 0-50 cm (1 h)
- 2016-: weather variables (1 min)
- 2016-April 2024: light data (1 min); May 2024-: (0.5 s)

## Light spectrum measurements

- Special protocol and calibration from STUK (Lasse Ylianttila).
- Near-real time computations and direct data acquisition from within R.
- Software already in use at Luke (Titta Kotilainen) and HU.
- Wavelength range 250-1050 nm.

## Research focus: acclimation<br>_resource or information driven?_

- Insight: many responses involved in acclimation are slow and difficult to reverse.
- Acclimation needs to be triggered in advance, but mistakes are costly to fitness or yield.

----------

- Correlations and lags among variables (cues and signals) in the environment make this possible (e.g., anticipated shade avoidance).
- _Collaborators:_ Matthew Robson, Jorge J. Casal, Víctor O. Sadras, Marcel Jansen, Ariel Novoplansky.
- Applications to agriculture and horticulture.
- _Collaborators:_ Titta Kotilainen, Alexey Shapiguzov, Tao Li, Elias Kaiser, Leo Marcelis, Daniel Calderini, Fred Stoddard, Hamid Khazei.

---------

- How do plants integrate information acquired from cues and signals?
- ... in time and space
- Control seems to be layered: "meta-plasticity", i.e., plasticity is plastic.
- What are good sources of information in the environment? that plants can sense...
- We know more about the plants' responses than...
- ...about the details of the environment they are exposed to (natural or production).

## Theory and the bigger picture

- Stress and strain definitions at different levels of organization: a source of conflict.
- Stress, acclimation and fitness definitions: are they consistent?
- What plant-related research useful to horticulture/agriculture/forestry?
- Collaborators: Víctor O. Sadras, Marcel Jansen.

## Current methods focus

- Light environment: high frequency $(\approx 5\,\mathrm{ms})$ and special geometries (hemispherical and radial entrance optics), broad-band and spectral measurements.
- Simulated sunflecks and daylight with LEDs in controlled environments.
- Software for acquisition, visualization and analysis of data.
- "Technical" collaborators: Alan Morrison (U. C. Cork, electronic engineering), Stefan Langer (**sg**lux GmbH, Berlin), Bentham Instruments (Reading, U.K.), Nikolai Belevich (Helsinki), Lasse Ylianttila (STUK).

## Research after retirement

- I am looking forward to continuing collaboration with Luke researchers, with a more formal status.
- I hope this very broad introduction helps us find subjects of shared interest.
